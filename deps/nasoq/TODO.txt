- Removing OpenBLAS dependency. It downloads Openblas and build it but the install directory is scattered. It creates heqdar conflict.
- Return value for LBL
- Adding repro BLAS for reporoducability: http://bebop.cs.berkeley.edu/reproblas/
- Adding support for box constraint.
- Fortran interface.
- Fixing the solution memory allocation
- Reseting factor feature for reusing symbolic object.
- API for using updown feature.
- Adding AMD ordering: Right now AMD is supported but I should copy the AMD code and enable the option.
- Fixing NASOQ-Tuned variants and make it accessible through an API
- Smart scaling based on the problem. 
- Matlab interface is tested but some features are not accessible from Matlab
- Hand optimizing NASOQ code
- Adding fixed term to the objective
- Adding CHOLMOD mode inside the solver
- igl interface is done but not tested and integrated to igl.
